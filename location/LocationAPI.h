        If one or more unspecified bits are set in the NMEA mask,
        those bits will be ignored, but the rest of the
        configuration will get applied.

        Prior to calling this API for a particular engine, the
        engine shall not calcualte the protection levels and shall
        not include the protection levels in its position report.

        Currently, only PPE engine will support this function.
        LocConfigCb() will return LOC_INT_RESPONSE_NOT_SUPPORTED

        integrity risk level for protection level calculation. The
        protection level will be returned back in

        calculating protection level in
        LocationClientApi::GnssLocation. <br/>

        The integrity risk is defined as a probability per epoch,
        in unit of 2.5e-10. The valid range for actual integrity is
